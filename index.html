This was by far the hardest thing I've had to do this semester. About 20 times I would sit for hours adjusting things 
over and over in an attempt to fix a formatting issue only for it to turn out I had made a dumb mistake like putting
the CSS in an incorrect order, or things weren't nested properly, etc. Hopefully this gets better wth practice!

        <h2>Jazz</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Jazz music is possibly the most captivating musical genre
            of all time. I started playing jazz in middle school and
            honestly wasn't really a fan as my exposure to it was
            hearing our school band and other school bands play at
            a mediocre level. Once I had the experience of witnessing
            a professional jazz band play, I finally was hooked. The
            raw talent that jazz musicians exude on stage is incredible.

        <h2>Indie</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Indie is a genre I didn't fully start immersing myself in
            until well after I was an adult. I started teaching myself
            the guitar, and after starting to learn songs at home I
            fell in love with Indie and Acoustic music. There are so
            many Indie artists to see locally here in Utah, and the
            community is honestly one of the best parts. I've been to
            dozens of Indie music festivals, open mics, large conerts,
            and even a few 'sleepover concerts'.

        <h2>Rock</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Rock is the biggest constant in my life. I was raised
            on classic rock by my dad and attended countless rock
            concerts before I was evern a teenager. My love of
            rock has expanded greatly to also include every variety
            including garage, punk, alt, and even hard rock/metal.
            When I'm sad I listen to rock. When I'm working out I
            listen to rock. While my other music tastes have varied
            and changed, this has been my main staple in my music my
            whole life.
